rubygem-svn2git-srpm
====================

Wrapper for SRPM building tools for the svn2git rubygem.

I used the 'gem2rpm' tool to build this.

* gem2rpm --fetch svn2git > rubygem-svn2git.spec

Just download the relevant gem from the Source entry, and run these commands.

* make # to build designated versions with "mock"
* make build # to build local copy
